<h2>Gravity Maze</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game is an improvement on my origional gravity blob game, but with new level design and game mechanics.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This sequel adds on to the already exciting gravity manipulation mechanic with new and improved tech. The biggest complaint from the origional game was the misleading hitboxes on
the spike. I fixed this by using the higher quality matter.js game engine and using this to create very precise triangular hitboxes for the spikes, which now have very precise
hitboxes. Additionally this engine change allowed me to create a new object type for puzzles that changes gravity with the blob.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Creating this game helped me learn a lot about hitboxes and collision checking. The hardest part of this process was learning how to use the matter.js engine, as it is
very different from the standard engine, and there are very few resources for it.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Some of the assets I used were made from scratch, such as the spikes and platforms, and some of them were found online, with a roughly even spread.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The closest game to this one would be the origional Gravity Blob, as they share almost all of their basic game mechanics. I used an additional plugin for matter.js here
https://github.com/mikewesthad/phaser-matter-collision-plugin
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This game uses gravity to platform in ways you wouldn't normally see.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
This is really just the story of a slimy little blob trying to overcome adversity and find happiness.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This is a platformer game that uses the WASD buttons to move the character, and the arrow bottons to change the direction of gravity. There is some amount of variety in the
game where there are precise platforming sections, puzzle sections, and some fast paced speed sections.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The main intention of this prototype was to improve upon existing technology, and to learn more about creating large and interesting maps. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player experience that I would like to impart would be an excitement over the creative movement options, and the desire to explore every corner of the maze.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
There are only a few necessary controls for this game to run, but I feel that they interact smoothly together. In terms of direct character movement the only controls
are left and right movement (initially A and D on the keyboard). You can controll gravity with the arrow keys, and you will fall in the direction that you press. If you turn 
the gravity to the left or right, the A and D buttons will no longer do anything, as they will be replaced with the W and S buttons to control the character's movement.
This is done to ensure that the gravity transitions are as seamless as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I expect that one popular strategy would be to rapidly change gravity back and forth, to slowly and carefully get the character where you want him to go. Another strategy that 
I expect to see, would be players just thinking up and down, rather than omnidirectionally. This is not what I would like to see, and I made some effort to punish
players who try to think that way.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player wakes up in the center of a maze and all they wish to do is escape. All you know is that for some reason you became a small slime ball, and gained the ability to
manipulate gravity. Using this ability you must navigate through deadly spikes and mind-boggling puzzles in order to try and find the exit.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
My target audience is people who like cute little slime balls, and dislike the rigidly enforced laws of gravity.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
I would expect it to take the average player roughly 30-45 minutes to be able to successfully escape the maze.
