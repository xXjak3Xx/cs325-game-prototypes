<h2>Gravity Blob</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game offers freedeom of movement via gravity manipulation, allowing players to move much more freely than most other 2d platformers.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The most interseting part of my game is the way that the character can change the gravity to pull you up down left or right. Additionally the character sprite rotates with this change
	and much like a cat always lands on his feet.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot about javascript in general as this is one of my first experiences with the language, and I learned a lot about loading and rendering assets.
The hardest part for me was loading in the map and tiles that I had created, and ironing out the the specific interaction data for each tile.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Some of the assets I used were made from scratch, such as the spikes and platforms, and some of them were found online, with a roughly even spread.

	<li> <a href="http://soundbible.com/1469-Depth-Charge-Short.html">Explosion sound</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
While I thought it was an original idea at first, a quick google search shows that this is far from the first gravity manipulation-based game, with vvvvv being the most
similar looking result. The code I wrote is all original, with the only notable help being in basic comprehension from the tutorial, and code from the api.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This game uses gravity to platform in ways you wouldn't normally see.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
This is really just the story of a slimy little blob trying to overcome adversity and find happiness.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This is a platformer game that uses the WASD buttons to move the character, and the arrow bottons to change the direction of gravity. There is no randomness in this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The main intention of this prototype was to evaluate if the gravity manipulation gameplay mechanic, with all the sprite and animation transformations invlolved would
be a viable core for future games. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player experience that I would like to impart would be an excitement over the creative movement options, and a desire for more.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
There are only a few necessary controls for this game to run, but I feel that they interact smoothly together.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>

</ul>
