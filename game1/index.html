<h2>Gravity Blob</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game offers freedeom of movement via gravity manipulation, allowing players to move much more freely than most other 2d platformers.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The most interseting part of my game is the way that the character can change the gravity to pull you up down left or right. Additionally the character sprite rotates with this change
	and much like a cat always lands on his feet.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot about javascript in general as this is one of my first experiences with the language, and I learned a lot about loading and rendering assets.
The hardest part for me was loading in the map and tiles that I had created, and ironing out the the specific interaction data for each tile.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Some of the assets I used were made from scratch, such as the spikes and platforms, and some of them were found online, with a roughly even spread.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
While I thought it was an original idea at first, a quick google search shows that this is far from the first gravity manipulation-based game, with vvvvv being the most
similar looking result. The code I wrote is all original, with the only notable help being in basic comprehension from the tutorial, and code from the api.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This game uses gravity to platform in ways you wouldn't normally see.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
This is really just the story of a slimy little blob trying to overcome adversity and find happiness.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This is a platformer game that uses the WASD buttons to move the character, and the arrow bottons to change the direction of gravity. There is no randomness in this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The main intention of this prototype was to evaluate if the gravity manipulation gameplay mechanic, with all the sprite and animation transformations invlolved would
be a viable core for future games. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player experience that I would like to impart would be an excitement over the creative movement options, and a desire for more.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
There are only a few necessary controls for this game to run, but I feel that they interact smoothly together. In terms of direct character movement the only controls
are left and right movement (initially A and D on the keyboard). You can controll gravity with the arrow keys, and you will fall in the direction that you press. If you turn 
the gravity to the left or right, the A and D buttons will no longer do anything, as they will be replaced with the W and S buttons to control the character's movement.
This is done to ensure that the gravity transitions are as seamless as possible. A future gameplay change that I have been considering would be to limit the number of
times you can change the gravity in the air, as I feel that make the game more challenging.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I expect that one popular strategy would be to rapidly change gravity back and forth, to slowly and carefully get the character where you want him to go. Another strategy that 
I expect to see, would be players just thinking up and down, rather than omnidirectionally. This is not what I would like to see, and I made some effort to punish
players who try to think that way.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This is an abstract game in which a small little slime ball (who just happens to control gravity) is in search of happiness. The game can be seen as a metaphor, 
because no matter where the slime ball looks he's still seemingly trapped in a box, much like how people can feel trapped in their own lives. Despite the fact
that the slime ball has the power to control gravity he still can't control his own fate, and as such has to find happiness wherever he can. Where will you find happiness?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
My target audience is people who like cute little slime balls, and dislike the rigidly enforced laws of gravity.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Much like life my game offers limitless entertainment to those enlightened enough to find it. In terms of exploring the whole map though you could likely explore all of it within
five to ten minutes.
