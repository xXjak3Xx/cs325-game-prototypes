<h2>A Crime Most Foul</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's a decision based police investigation game.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What's interesting about my technology is that the decisions on who you choose to investigate, and who you think is responsible for the crime will change the outcome, and
there are many different endings.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
In making this prototype I learned two very important things. One, that textboxes and and menus are a pain to make, and two that trying to come up with a bunch of branching
and intersecting paths will literally drive you insane.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://opengameart.org/content/police-2d-sprite">Police Sprite</a><li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I'd say that the closest game to this would be Bandersnatch. The goal was similar with the branching story paths, but just to a lesser extent.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Using your powers of detectiveness investegate a crime and solve it with your critical thinking skills.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
This is a story heavy game with lots a good amount of music.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
There is no randomness in this game, it is mostly just following along with the story in the path of your choice, with some problem solving skills sprikled in.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating the idea of using decision making to control various story based outcomes and endings that the user can experience within the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to be able to relax and enjoy an entertaining story filled with unique characters and hopefully solve the mystery themselves.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The controls for this game are pretty simple. When reading dialog you just press the Enter key to continue on to the next dialog. When making a choice you use the left and right 
arrow keys to scroll between the choices, and the enter key to select the choice that you prefer.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I expect that the player's initial strategy will be to try and secure a conviction as quickly as possible, without spending enough time looking through the evidence. While they
may succeed in getting the conviction, they surely won't have figured out who the true criminal is.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
18 year old Robert Cook was found murdered in his dorm room at Gregory Manson Unniversity. Investigate Robert's friends and peers to try and uncover every possible clue to help
lead you towards the true answer. As you learn more about Robert and his fellow Unniversity students you'll see that nobody is perfect, and when put under such an intense lens
even the most straight-edged students can be mistaken for homocidal monsters.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The demographic I'm tyring to reach is people who enjoy story-driven decision based games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
You should be able to reach the "true ending" within 10-20 minutes.
</li>
