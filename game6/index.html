<h2>Never Tell Me The Odds</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This is a game about gambling and dueling your friends.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game features two dice type rng for two players to duke it using the power of odds.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned about trying to create a balanced two player game, and about the difficulties of rng and turn-based battle gameplay.  The most difficult part of this game
was making the turn based aspect fluidly alternate between players.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets used in this prototype were original.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The closest other game to mine would most likely be slay the spire. I haven't played the game before, but after talking to some people about my game I was told that it reminded
them of that, as they're both turn based rpg card games.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Test your luck with this high stakes game of cards against your friends in which you'll have to believe in the heart of the cards to emerge victorious.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme is western as many of the card names are inspired by western tropes.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
There is a lot of randomness, because as a gambling centered game there is rng galore.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The main mechanic this prototype is evaluating is turn based pvp combat.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the players to feel frusterated when they don't get the rolls they want, and excited when they do.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Each player has a hand of four cards that they can use. They take turns selecting a card, and then rolling to see if they got the required numbers to be able to play the chosen card.
The first player to reduce the opponent's hp to zero wins. There are 8 different cards each of which has a different effect and required numbers to be rolled. Flick[2-12]: deal
4 damage to the opponent. Two Tries[2-12]: Roll two dice and deal damage equal to the higher of the two.  Slap[odds]: Deal 10 damage to the opponent. Light Beer[evens]: heal for
5 hp. Shotgun[3-5]: Heal for 15 hp. Heads or Tails[9-12]: If heads deal 20 damage, and if tails heal for 20 hp. Six Shooter[6]: Roll two dice and deal 6 times the sum of the
two dice damage to the opponent. Critical Hit[12]: Deal 60 damage to the opponent.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
One strategy could be to go for low, consistant damage, and another would be to go for high hail mary damage.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You're gambling in the old west. Hopefully you have the mettle to walk away with your opponent's bag of cash. Otherwise you'll be the one leaving empty handed.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is gambling and turn based rpg fans.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
On average it takes about five minutes to play.
</li>
