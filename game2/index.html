<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game is an origional mix of strategy and action.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game allows the player to spawn minions of their choice.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
From this prototype I learned how to work with groups of npcs. The hardest part of this project was creating all the different slime classes.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The original slime image isn't original, but the modified ones are.  Also the explosion sound isn't original.
<ul>
<li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://soundbible.com/1469-Depth-Charge-Short.html">Explosion Sound</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The closest game that I'd say this resembles would be age of war, which is an old flash game where you similarly spend gold to buy units to fight the war.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The goal of this game is to defeat the other player by spawning minions, and farming the opponents minions.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The story is that the armies of the virtuous blue slimes and the evil red slimes fight to determine the greatest of the slimes.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The genre of this game is that of a action strategy game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The primary mechanic that this game is testing a player's ability to create npc minions during the course of a game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the players to be able to experience the feeling of out-playing their opponent to win against their friends.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
For this game the player uses a combination of RPG-esque farming mechanics along with RTS-style minion spawning mechanics to try and percure victory. Each player can move forward and
backward with the W and A, or left and right keys, and fire their slow, and initially weak gun with W or up. If a player last hits five minions with the gun they recieve 8 extra gold
(on top of the standard one gold per second passive income). Additionally every five minions you last hit will double the damage of your gun. The 1 2 and 3 keys (or { } | keys) 
will spawn tank, ranged, and assassin minions respectively. The tank minions move slowly and do low damage, but have high health, and cost 10 gold. The ranged minions do moderate
damage, have very low health, move slowly but are the only minion with range, and cost 15 gold. The Assassin minions have medium health, high damage and very high speed, and cost
20 gold.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
A powerful strategy in this game is putting ranged minions behind tank minions for optimal minion fighting. Another viable strategy is to use tank minions to  shield the player
while they build up the strength of their gun. One final viable strategy is to rush your opponent with the high speed of the assassin minions.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The story is that the red blobs want to fight the blue blobs because they don't have brains and are incapable of being friends despite their different colors.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
My target audience is competative people.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
My game usually takes about 5 minutes to completes.
</li>
